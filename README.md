#About Yearly Projects
This idea was inspired after watching [1 year of C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrEvoKI07Ww&t=1s) . In which I was inspired to complete 12 projects throughout 2018 that will utilize various concepts, tools, frameworks, etc; that are new to me and will challenge me to improve as a developer.

#Project 1: LightBox Image Gallery

**Languages & Libraries**: Javascript, PHP, Lightbox

This project was programmed utilizing the Javascript library: [LightBox](http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/).

The Image Gallery was developed for a friend's personal site, who's into photography and graphic design. The gallery will display images in accordance to their most recent modification date.
The gallery auto-populates 20 images(10 on mobile) and allows users to press a Show More button to display 20(or 10) more images each click.

The code for the Image Gallery was bartered with him to get some graphic design work done on my site.
